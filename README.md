# Blackjack counter with basic strategy without accounting for deviation

Basic manual blackjack counter with basic strategy. Program is based on running count and playing with 8 decks.


#### TODO

1. account for deviation of true count*
2. add input for already played cards (deferred / discarded cards)
3. work on design (not soon probably)
4. automate, use image processing (not soon)
5. add player advantage (%)


*you can easily account for the deviation by playing with positive true count only (positive true count means there is bigger probabilty of getting larger numbers and vice versa)
